Full-Stack Development using the MERN Stack is a modern approach to building web applications. MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it highly adaptable to various data structures. Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, is designed for creating robust APIs efficiently. React.js, a JavaScript library, excels in building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Node.js, a server-side platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enables JavaScript to be used for backend development.
